How to read clock:

Minutes: The centerpiece depicting a large crescent moon and star with one of the points slightly elongated indicating the current minute.

Hours: A smaller moon + star symbol placed on the current hour alongside the minute hand.

Seconds: Rotating points on the left and right side however, there's no way to indicate how many seconds there currently are in each minute.

Week 1:
Ideas:
- Rotating array of points in a ring formation (resembling the sun which will be the starting point)
- Inside that ring is another rotating smaller circle with a crescent moon
- Both rotating in second intervals in opposite directions
- Throughout the day the sun ring will shrink and by the end of the day the moon ring would have enlarged in place of the sun ring
- Side rings will rotate in minutes
- Time indication can be in Roman numerals possibly in a vertical scale and at each level indicates the current hour when one of the rings reaches it(though this could be a problem since there are two rings)
- I could solve this by having the sun ring as the main hour indicator with only the enlarging and shrinking motion and no rotation, its array of points will be offset as its own rotating ring
- star symbols will act as clock hands(one place outside of the outer ring and one on the inside)
- tiny stars replace sun points during moon phase

Progress: 
- Laid out main positions of each element as well as drawing assets to import into the code
- Kept the designs of each asset slightly more simple compared to its initial sketch as over time I'll be adding more elements 

Week 2:
- At first the rotating asset was exported as displaying a whole ring of points but I later decided to export just the singular point for each variation so I could form the ring as an array which is more easier to fiddle with their placements
