## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

### THIS IS YOUR README

Update this file as you go along to record your progress.

Ideas:
- Rotating array of points in a ring formation (resembling the sun which will be the starting point
- Inside that ring is another rotating smaller circle with a crescent moon
- Both rotating in second intervals in opposite directions
- Throughout the day the sun ring will shrink and by the end of the day the moon ring would have enlarged in place of the sun ring
- Side rings will rotate in minutes
- Time indication will be in Roman numerals
- star symbols will act as clock hands(one place outside of the outer ring and one on the inside)
